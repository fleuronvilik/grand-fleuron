## Unfinished Business

- Django for everybody, short [dj4e](https://www.dj4e.com/)
- [Freecodecamp Relational Database Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/)
- Firebase on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnfirebase)
- In-Depth Vue 3 (Pizza Planet) on Skillshare
- etc.

The ```npm run production``` command will remove any unused CSS with Purgecss and minify the CSS and JS files.

I highly recommend using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to host your site on, so I've included a ```netlify.toml``` configuration file for your convenience.
